# SPDEsclm
SPDEsclm addresses censored and missing data in spatial statistics by approximating Gaussian Random Fields (GRF) with Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) via Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE). It uses the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) algorithm for efficient parameter estimation.
