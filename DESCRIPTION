Description: It provides a function to estimate parameters in linear spatial models with censored/missing responses via the Stochastic Approximation EM (SAEM) algorithm. To reduce the processing time, it is used an approximation of the Gaussian spatial process with matérn correlation by a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) obtained as a solution of a spatial partial differential equation (SPDE) as proposed by Sahoo et al. (2018)<https: //doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.15670>.
